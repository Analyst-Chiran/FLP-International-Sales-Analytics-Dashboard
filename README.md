# FLP-International-Sales-Analytics-Dashboard
This sales analytics project focused on analyzing the sales performance of Forever Living Products International Inc., using data sourced from Kaggle.com. The business goal was to identify key sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance across regions to enable strategic decision-making and improve market targeting.

The project involved several tasks:

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Raw sales data was preprocessed in Excel, where inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values were handled to ensure data accuracy.
Analysis and Visualization: Analytical techniques such as segmentation, trend analysis, and comparative analysis were applied. Metrics like sales by age group, gender, product category, and regional performance were analyzed.
Dashboard Creation: An interactive dashboard was designed in Excel to visualize findings, providing stakeholders with an intuitive way to explore insights.
To achieve these goals, tools like Excel's advanced functions, pivot tables, and charting capabilities were used. Data was segmented by dimensions such as country, product category, and customer demographics, and key performance indicators (KPIs) were calculated to measure trends over time.

Main Insights
Demographic Trends: Adults aged 35-64 were the dominant customer group, contributing significantly to total sales.
Product Performance: Clothing emerged as the top-performing category, accounting for 66% of total sales, followed by accessories.
Regional Analysis: The United States led in sales, followed by Australia and Canada, showing significant regional disparities.
Gender Insights: Male customers accounted for 55% of total sales, highlighting potential for targeted marketing.
This project demonstrates how data analytics can provide actionable insights, helping businesses identify high-value customer segments, optimize product offerings, and tailor regional strategies for sustained growth.
